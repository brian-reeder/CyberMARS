## Purpose
 Cyber MARS is a security and incident response report template to help standardize reporting for similar/common security events. By adding in artifacts, you can reference specific fields or attributes by a distinct identifier and streamline reports. The template fragment in the URL has been designed specifically to minimize the amount of sensitive information sent to the server or shared in the URL. Data following the # character is not sent to any server, and is decoded locally by your browser. Raw event data is also excluded from the fragment, it's purpose is to store configuration details and template information not live security data.
